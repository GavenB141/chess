# Unnamed Chess Project
I plan to grow this into something bigger, but for now it's a minimal chess implementation with only support for same-screen multiplayer.

### Currently missing:
- Castling
- En Passant
- Pawn Promotion

### Known issue:
Pawns aren't counted for checks and can capture the king for some reason
